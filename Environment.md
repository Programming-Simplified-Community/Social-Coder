# Dev Container

Rather than installing a bunch of stuff locally, such as the right dotnet SDK you can use a dev container!

You will, however, need to have docker installed locally.

## Rider

Click the blue cube,

Then press **Create Dev Container and Mount Sources -> Rider**

Rider will then create the dev-container, mounting Rider's backend IDE. When
 complete, you will be able to connect to the dev-container.
